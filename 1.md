## Q1. IP address 
IP address is basically number that identify computer on TCP/IP network. TCP/IP is network protocol. IP address identifies your
computer on the internet or local network. So other computer can relate you. Because computers talk to each other by number. IP 
address is four set of numbers not more than 255 numbers. 
Two types of ip addresses inside of home networks . outside of the home network i.e internet.  
  
 ## Q.2 LAN
Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computer and workstations can share data, tools and
programs. LAN  You need a router and ethernet cable to join the computer by router using ethernet. The router is negotiating 
between the computers and allow them to exchange the information.  

## Q.2 WAN
WAN is a network that spans large geographical locations, usually to interconnect multiple Local Area Networks (LANs). 
Lan are built, owned nad operated by individual companies and organization WAN are owned by thied party service provider. for example telephone company. Trdational WAN protocol are physical layer (layer 1) and Data link layer (layer 2).
Each WAN technology such as PPP or frame Relay, uses a different layer 2 frame format and provides dufferent options for relability and error recovery.  
(Layer 2.5)MPLS is not a WAN technology but WAN services that operates between layer 2 and 3. 
 
The physical layer (OSI Layer 1) protocols describe how to provide electrical, mechanical, operational, and functional connections to the services of a communications service provider.   
The data link layer (OSI Layer 2) protocols define how data is encapsulated for transmission toward a remote location and the mechanisms for transferring the resulting frames. A variety of technologies are used, such as Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  
  
  # port
 A network port is a process-specific or an application-specific software construct serving as a communication endpoint, which is serving communication between two or more computers. used by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) .  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.    
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that works just like TCP 
For example, UDP is frequently used for live broadcasts and online games. For example, let’s say you’re watching a live video stream, which are often broadcast using UDP instead of TCP. The server just sends a constant stream of UDP packets to computers watching.   

# NIC
 A network interface card (NIC) is a circuit board or card that is installed in a computer so that it can be connected to a network. 
  
  # operating system
An operating system is the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer.
An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.    
 For example, when an application wants to print something, it hands that task off to the operating system. The operating system sends the instructions to the printer, using the printer’s drivers to send the correct signals. The application that’s printing doesn’t have to care about what printer you have or understand how it works. The OS handles the details.    
The Core of an Operating System is the Kernel.    
At a low level, the “kernel” is the core computer program at the heart of your operating system. This single program is one of the first things loaded when your operating system starts up. It handles allocating memory, converting software functions to instructions for your computer’s CPU, and dealing with input and output from hardware devices. The kernel is generally run in an isolated area to prevent it from being tampered with by other software on the computer. The operating system kernel is very important but is just one part of the operating system.

 # Types of Operating Systems     
  Batch System:
In this type of system, there is no direct interaction between user and the computer.    
Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator.   
To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group.    
Then a special program, the monitor, manages the execution of each program in the batch.    
Examples   
Bank statements   
For a bank, regardless if it’s small or large scale, would need to keep records of their customers, be it for security or financial purposes. Especially when there is a need to send information, a batch processing operating system works for such a scenario due to a large number of details it needs to process.

# Multi Programming system   
 Multiprogramming is a technique to execute a number of programs simultaneously by a single processor.   
In multiprogramming, a number of processes reside in main memory at a time.   
The OS picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in main memory.   
If any I/O wait happens in a process, then the CPU switches from that job to another job.   
Hence in a Multiprogramming system, the CPU will never be idle and keeps on processing.   
If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the system chooses which one to run (using CPU Scheduling).

# Time Sharing Systems 
Time sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming.  
In such a system, there are more than one user interacting with the system at the same time.  
Multiple jobs are executed by switching the CPU between them but the switches occur so frequently that users can interact   with each program while it is running and the user can assume that he is only working on the system, but actually the CPU is  shared among different users.  
Here CPU time is shared by different processes. So this system is called a time sharing system.   
The CPU scheduler selects a job from the ready queue and switches the CPU to that job. When the time slot expires, the CPU switches from this job to another job.  
The time slice is given by the OS for sharing CPU time between processes.  
* Time sharing system uses   
CPU scheduling   
Multiprogramming   
Memory management scheme   
UNIX is a time shared system.

# Distributed Operating System
 Distributed OS are the OS for a network of autonomous(independent) computers, connected by a communication network, that follows message passing mechanisms.   
In this system, processors cannot share memory or clock. Each processor has its own local memory.   
The processors communicate with one another through various communication lines such as high speed buses.   
A distributed OS controls and manages the software and hardware resources of a distributed system.  
When a program is executed on a distributed system, the user is not aware of where the program is executed, on which location etc.   
The basic design issue of distributed operating system is:   
Process Synchronization  
Deadlock   
Inter process communication   
Memory Management   
CPU scheduling  
Nearly all systems today are distributed in some way i.e.   
They use email   
Access files over a network  
Receive audios and videos etc.

# Network Operating System
This particular OS runs and provides a server access to data, users, groups, security, applications and other networking functions. By allowing a shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, or what is called Local Area Network (LAN), makes up the primary use for the Network Operating System.  
Examples   
Windows 2000 server   
It has Active Directory that manages and enables security, as well as extending the interconnection between the operating   system in the network.

# Real Time Operating System 
The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time interval is called response time.   
![Real Time Operating System ](https://www.computer-realm.net/wp-content/uploads/post-images/2018/10/workflow.png)  

Real time systems are classified into two categories:  

1. Hard Real Time System  
2. Soft Real Time System    
* Hard Real Time System 
The task of Hard Real Time System s are of the order of micro or milliseconds.These systems guarantee that critical tasks should be completed on time.   
Examples: : Industrial control applications   
 Robots  
* Soft Real Time System   
A system is said to be soft real time system, If a deadline is missed, the system does not fail.     
 # process    
 A process or running process refers to a set of instructions currently being processed by the computer processor.   
For example  
In Windows you can see each of the processes running by opening the Processes tab in Task Manager.
