## Q1. IP address 
IP address is basically number that identify computer on TCP/IP network. TCP/IP is network protocol. IP address identifies your
computer on the internet or local network. So other computer can relate you. Because computers talk to each other by number. IP 
address is four set of numbers not more than 255 numbers. 
Two types of ip addresses inside of home networks . outside of the home network i.e internet.  
  
 ## Q.2 LAN
Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computer and workstations can share data, tools and
programs. LAN  You need a router and ethernet cable to join the computer by router using ethernet. The router is negotiating 
between the computers and allow them to exchange the information.  

## Q.2 WAN
WAN is a network that spans large geographical locations, usually to interconnect multiple Local Area Networks (LANs). 
Lan are built, owned nad operated by individual companies and organization WAN are owned by thied party service provider. for example telephone company. Trdational WAN protocol are physical layer (layer 1) and Data link layer (layer 2).
Each WAN technology such as PPP or frame Relay, uses a different layer 2 frame format and provides dufferent options for relability and error recovery.  
(Layer 2.5)MPLS is not a WAN technology but WAN services that operates between layer 2 and 3. 
 
The physical layer (OSI Layer 1) protocols describe how to provide electrical, mechanical, operational, and functional connections to the services of a communications service provider.   
The data link layer (OSI Layer 2) protocols define how data is encapsulated for transmission toward a remote location and the mechanisms for transferring the resulting frames. A variety of technologies are used, such as Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
