## Q1. IP address 
IP address is basically number that identify computer on TCP/IP network. TCP/IP is network protocol. IP address identifies your
computer on the internet or local network. So other computer can relate you. Because computers talk to each other by number. IP 
address is four set of numbers not more than 255 numbers. 
Two types of ip addresses inside of home networks . outside of the home network i.e internet.  
  
 ## Q.2 LAN
Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computer and workstations can share data, tools and
programs. LAN  You need a router and ethernet cable to join the computer by router using ethernet. The router is negotiating 
between the computers and allow them to exchange the information.  

## Q.2 WAN
WAN is a network that spans large geographical locations, usually to interconnect multiple Local Area Networks (LANs). 
Lan are built, owned nad operated by individual companies and organization WAN are owned by thied party service provider. for example telephone company. Trdational WAN protocol are physical layer (layer 1) and Data link layer (layer 2).
Each WAN technology such as PPP or frame Relay, uses a different layer 2 frame format and provides dufferent options for relability and error recovery.  
(Layer 2.5)MPLS is not a WAN technology but WAN services that operates between layer 2 and 3. 
 
The physical layer (OSI Layer 1) protocols describe how to provide electrical, mechanical, operational, and functional connections to the services of a communications service provider.   
The data link layer (OSI Layer 2) protocols define how data is encapsulated for transmission toward a remote location and the mechanisms for transferring the resulting frames. A variety of technologies are used, such as Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  
  
  # port
 A network port is a process-specific or an application-specific software construct serving as a communication endpoint, which is serving communication between two or more computers. used by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) .  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.    
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that works just like TCP 
For example, UDP is frequently used for live broadcasts and online games. For example, let’s say you’re watching a live video stream, which are often broadcast using UDP instead of TCP. The server just sends a constant stream of UDP packets to computers watching.   

# NIC
 A network interface card (NIC) is a circuit board or card that is installed in a computer so that it can be connected to a network. 
  
  # operating system
An operating system is the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer.
An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.    
 For example, when an application wants to print something, it hands that task off to the operating system. The operating system sends the instructions to the printer, using the printer’s drivers to send the correct signals. The application that’s printing doesn’t have to care about what printer you have or understand how it works. The OS handles the details.    
The Core of an Operating System is the Kernel.    
At a low level, the “kernel” is the core computer program at the heart of your operating system. This single program is one of the first things loaded when your operating system starts up. It handles allocating memory, converting software functions to instructions for your computer’s CPU, and dealing with input and output from hardware devices. The kernel is generally run in an isolated area to prevent it from being tampered with by other software on the computer. The operating system kernel is very important but is just one part of the operating system.
