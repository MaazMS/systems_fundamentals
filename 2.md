## Q7 virtualisation
virtualisation refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual ) version of something  including virtual computer   
hardware platforms, storage etc.  
In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes. One is a mail server,   
another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications. Each server is being used at about 30%   
capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But since the legacy apps remain important to your internal operations,  
you have to keep them and the third server that hosts them, right?     
![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/server-usage-500x131.png)      
Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers: 1 server, 1 operating  
system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But with virtualization, you can split the mail server into  
2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the same hardware, you’re just using  
more of it more efficiently.
![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/server-usage-for-virtualization-500x131.png)  
Keeping security in mind, you could split the first server again so it could handle another task—increasing its use from 30%,    
to 60%, to 90%. Once you do that, the now empty servers could be reused for other tasks or retired altogether to reduce   
cooling and maintenance costs.      
#### How does virtualization work?
Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources.  
Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server),  
which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual   
environments can use them.    
![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/how-virtualization-works-400x217.png)
. Users interact with and run computations within the virtual environment (typically called a guest machine or virtual machine).  
## Q8 Types of virtualization  
### Data virtualization  
![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/data%20virtualization.png)   
Data virtualization tools sit in front of multiple data sources and allows them to be treated as single source, delivering  
the needed data—in the required form—at the right time to any application or user.  
 
### Desktop virtualization  
 ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/desktop%20virtualization_0.png)  
operating system virtualization—which allows you to deploy multiple operating systems on a single machine.  
desktop virtualization allows a central administrator (or automated administration tool) to deploy simulated desktop   
environments to hundreds of physical machines at once.  
  
### Server virtualization   
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/server-virtualization-layout-530x287_0.png)    
  Servers are computers designed to process a high volume of specific tasks really well so other computers—like laptops   
  and desktops—can do a variety of other tasks. Virtualizing a server lets it to do more of those specific functions and   
  involves partitioning it so that the components can be used to serve multiple functions.  
  
### Operating system virtualization    
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/operating-system-virtualization-400x321.png)      
  Operating system virtualization happens at the kernel—the central task managers of operating systems. It’s a useful way  
  to run Linux and Windows environments side-by-side. Enterprises can also push virtual operating systems to computers,  
  which:  
Reduces bulk hardware costs, since the computers don’t require such high out-of-the-box capabilities.  
Increases security, since all virtual instances can be monitored and isolated.  
 
### Network functions virtualization     
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/network-function-virtualization-400x337_0.png)       
  Network functions virtualization (NFV) separates a network's key functions (like directory services, file sharing, and IP   
  configuration)    
  # hypervisor   
  A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine   
  monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation  
  and management of those VMs.   
  The physical hardware, when used as a hypervisor, is called the host, while the many VMs that use its resources are guests.  
  The hypervisor treats resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool that can be easily reallocated between existing   
  guests or to new virtual machines.      
##  Q9 Types of hypervisors  
There are 2 different types of hypervisors that can be used for virtualization: type 1 and type 2 hypervisors.  
![](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/type-1-and-type-2-hypervisor-explanation.png)  
### Type 1  
A type 1 hypervisor, also referred to as a native or bare metal hypervisor, runs directly on the host’s hardware to manage   
guest operating systems. It takes the place of a host operating system and VM resources are scheduled directly to the   
hardware by the hypervisor.     
This type of hypervisor is most common in an enterprise data center or other server-based environments.      
### Type 2  
A type 2 hypervisor is also known as a hosted hypervisor, and is run on a conventional operating system as a software layer  
or application.  
It works by abstracting guest operating systems from the host operating system. VM resources are scheduled against a host   
operating system, which is then executed against the hardware.    
A type 2 hypervisor is better for individual users who want to run multiple operating systems on a personal computer.    
 
## Q10 what is UNIX
The original Unix operating system was developed at AT&T's Bell Labs research center in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, AT&T licensed Unix to third-party vendors, leading to the development of several Unix variants, including Berkeley Unix, HP-UX, AIX, and Microsoft's Xenix. In 1993, AT&T sold the rights to the Unix operating system to Novell, Inc., which a few years later sold the Unix trademark to the consortium that eventually became The Open Group.
Unix was developed using a high-level programming language (C) instead of platform-specific assembly language, enabling its portability across multiple computer platforms.   
 

* Key components
Proprietary Unix systems and their variants are characterized by several essential components:
Kernel: The kernel is the master control program of the operating system, handling memory management, system calls, and other low-level functions common to most programs, and providing drivers for controlling hardware.
Shell: The shell is an interactive program that provides an interface between the user and the kernel. The shell interprets commands entered by the user or supplied by a shell script, and passes them to the kernel for execution. Shells available for use on Unix and Unix-like systems include sh (the Bourne shell), bash (the Bourne-again shell), csh (the C shell), tcsh (the TENEX C shell), ksh (the Korn shell), and zsh (the Z shell).
File system: Unix and Unix-like operating systems employ a hierarchical (inverted tree) directory structure, with the root directory (/) at the top. 
 
Development environment: Most Unix and Unix-like systems include tools and libraries for writing, compiling, and debugging C, C++, and Fortran programs 
 

## Q11 File system 
'/' :The root directory, where the whole tree starts   
'/bin':Contains fundamental executables (binaries) generally used by all users on the system (for example, chmod, cp, mv, grep, and tar)    
'/etc' :Contains local configuration files, subdirectories containing configuration files for large software packages (such as the X11 window system)   
'/lib':Contains shared libraries needed to boot the system and run the commands in the root file system     
'/tmp':Local scratch space for storing temporary files, which may be deleted without notice    
'/usr/bin':The primary directory for most executables used by normal users on the system (for example, emacs, make, scp, sftp, ssh, and yum)     
'usr/lib' : Contains static and dynamic libraries, a few executables that usually are not invoked directly, and subdirectories for complex programs.  

## Q12 what is Linux
Linux is an open source operating system.  which means that you can use, copy, study, and change the software in any way. It is distributed with the source code so users can view and modify it. This is in contrast to Microsoft Windows, a proprietary operating system.
Many versions of Linux exist. Some of the more popular Linux distributions are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.    
Today, Linux runs almost every computing platform available: mobile phones, tablets, servers, desktops, mainframes, etc. Android, a widely used operating system for mobile phones and tablets is based on the Linux kernel.           
Every OS has component parts, and the Linux OS also has the following components parts.                 
'Bootloader':. Your computer needs to go through a startup sequence called booting. This boot process needs guidance, and your OS is the software in control throughout the boot process. When you start your computer the bootloader for your operating system kickstarts the process.     
'OS Kernel':. You can call the kernel the part of the operating system which is the “closest” to your computing hardware as it is the part which controls the CPU, access to memory and any peripheral devices. It is the “lowest” level at which your operating system works.          
'Background services':. Called “daemons” in Linux, these small applications act as servants in the background, ensuring that key functions such as scheduling, printing and multimedia function correctly. They load after you have booted up, or when you have logged into your computer.             
'OS Shell':. You need to be able to tell our operating system what to do, and this is the goal of the shell. Also known as the command line, it is a facility which lets you instruct your OS using text.            
'Graphics server':. This provides a graphical sub-system that renders images and shapes on your computer monitor. Linux uses a graphical server called “X” or “X-server”.                 
'Desktop environment':. You can’t interact with the graphical server directly. Instead you need software that can drive the server. This is called a desktop environment in Linux and there are plenty of options including KDE, Unity and Cinnamon. A desktop environment is usually bundled with a number of applications including file and web browsers plus a couple of games.               

## Q13 Types of Linux user
There are three types of user in linux: - root, regular and service.
* The root user account
This is the main user account in Linux system. It is automatically created during the installation. It has the highest privilege in system. It can do any administrative work and can access any service. This account is intended for system administration and should be used only for this purpose
* The regular user account
This is the normal user account. During the installation, one regular user account is created automatically. After the installation, we can create as many regular user accounts as we need.It can perform only the tasks for which it is allowed and can access only those files and services for which it is authorized. As per requirement, it can be disabled or deleted. 
* The service account
Service accounts are created by installation packages when they are installed.
Such as mail, game, apache etc have their own individual services account. These accounts are used by services to run processes and execute functions.

## Q14 virtual machine
A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.
In other words, a VM is a software application that performs most functions of a physical computer, actually behaving as a separate computer system.
A virtual machine, usually known as a guest, is created within another computing environment referred as a "host." Multiple virtual machines can exist within a single host at one time.             
 
Techopedia explains Virtual Machine (VM)       
Virtual machines are becoming more common with the evolution of virtualization technology. Virtual machines are often created to perform certain tasks that are different than tasks performed in a host environment.        
They are also widely implemented as a sandboxed environment that are separated from the rest of the network. They are used for testing purposes, especially to perform risky tasks such as running malicious software, testing operating systems or creating backups, and accessing malware-infected data.           
Virtual machines are implemented by software emulation methods or hardware virtualization techniques. A lightweight software known as hypervisor allocates the computing resources (RAM, CPU power, memory, storage, etc.) of the server or host to each VM, keeping all of them separate to avoid interference.             
The computer’s operating system and applications are separated from its hardware so that each new virtual machine can access the physical resources of the original server, which are managed by the hypervisor.
Depending on their use and level of correspondence to any physical computer, virtual machines can be divided into two categories: 

* System Virtual Machines   

![](https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Virtual-Machine.jpg) 

A system platform that supports the sharing of the host computer's physical resources between multiple virtual machines, each running with its own copy of the operating system.            
The virtualization technique is provided by the hypervisor, which can run either on bare hardware or on top of an operating system.          

* Process Virtual Machines       

![](https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/Process-Virtual-Machine.jpg)       
A process VM, sometimes called an application virtual machine, runs as a normal application inside an OS and supports a single process. It is created when that process is started and destroyed when it exits. Its purpose is to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system, and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform.       
This type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java virtual machine. Another example is the .NET Framework, which runs on a VM called the Common Language Runtime.
