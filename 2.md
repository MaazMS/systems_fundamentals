# virtualisation
virtualisation refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual ) version of something  including virtual computer   
hardware platforms, storage etc.  
In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes. One is a mail server,   
another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications. Each server is being used at about 30%   
capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But since the legacy apps remain important to your internal operations,  
you have to keep them and the third server that hosts them, right?

Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers: 1 server, 1 operating  
system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But with virtualization, you can split the mail server into  
2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the same hardware, you’re just using  
more of it more efficiently.

Keeping security in mind, you could split the first server again so it could handle another task—increasing its use from 30%,    
to 60%, to 90%. Once you do that, the now empty servers could be reused for other tasks or retired altogether to reduce   
cooling and maintenance costs.      
# How does virtualization work?
Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources.  
Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server),  
which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual   
environments can use them.

. Users interact with and run computations within the virtual environment (typically called a guest machine or virtual machine).  
# Types of virtualization  
### Data virtualization  
![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/data%20virtualization.png)   
Data virtualization tools sit in front of multiple data sources and allows them to be treated as single source, delivering  
the needed data—in the required form—at the right time to any application or user.  
 
 ### Desktop virtualization  
 ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/desktop%20virtualization_0.png)  
operating system virtualization—which allows you to deploy multiple operating systems on a single machine.  
desktop virtualization allows a central administrator (or automated administration tool) to deploy simulated desktop   
environments to hundreds of physical machines at once.  
  
  ### Server virtualization   
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/server-virtualization-layout-530x287_0.png)    
  Servers are computers designed to process a high volume of specific tasks really well so other computers—like laptops   
  and desktops—can do a variety of other tasks. Virtualizing a server lets it to do more of those specific functions and   
  involves partitioning it so that the components can be used to serve multiple functions.  
  
  ### Operating system virtualization    
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/operating-system-virtualization-400x321.png)      
  Operating system virtualization happens at the kernel—the central task managers of operating systems. It’s a useful way  
  to run Linux and Windows environments side-by-side. Enterprises can also push virtual operating systems to computers,  
  which:  
Reduces bulk hardware costs, since the computers don’t require such high out-of-the-box capabilities.  
Increases security, since all virtual instances can be monitored and isolated.  
 
  ### Network functions virtualization     
  ![](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/network-function-virtualization-400x337_0.png)       
  Network functions virtualization (NFV) separates a network's key functions (like directory services, file sharing, and IP   
  configuration)    
  # hypervisor   
  A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine   
  monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation  
  and management of those VMs.   
  The physical hardware, when used as a hypervisor, is called the host, while the many VMs that use its resources are guests.  
  The hypervisor treats resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool that can be easily reallocated between existing   
  guests or to new virtual machines.      
 ##  Types of hypervisors  
There are 2 different types of hypervisors that can be used for virtualization: type 1 and type 2 hypervisors.

### Type 1  
A type 1 hypervisor, also referred to as a native or bare metal hypervisor, runs directly on the host’s hardware to manage   
guest operating systems. It takes the place of a host operating system and VM resources are scheduled directly to the   
hardware by the hypervisor.     
This type of hypervisor is most common in an enterprise data center or other server-based environments.      
### Type 2  
A type 2 hypervisor is also known as a hosted hypervisor, and is run on a conventional operating system as a software layer  
or application.  
It works by abstracting guest operating systems from the host operating system. VM resources are scheduled against a host   
operating system, which is then executed against the hardware.    
A type 2 hypervisor is better for individual users who want to run multiple operating systems on a personal computer.
